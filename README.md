# Github Visualisation Project

I decided to examine the relationship between Contributors and Commits for a user's repositories. 
I chose this because I am interested in issues such as the Mythical-Man month by Fred Brooks who suggested that adding more workers to a late software engineering project increases complexity and thus takes more time to complete.

## To run the program, you must have Docker installed and running.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `docker-compose up`

This will start the program on port 3000. To access this, run the command docker-machine ip default to figure out the ip address of the docker machine. Then enter the ip followed by :3000 in the browser. For me, it was the following: 

http://192.168.99.101:3000/

## Alternatively, you can run the program by using the following npm commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
